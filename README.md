## Hi! I'm Pablo and [I'm a dev](http://pablo.is-a.dev)

I'm a software developer based in Valencia, Spain.

I've worked in projects in Angular, Vue 2 and Vue 3 with the Options API.

Currently getting certified in the official Vue Certification Program.

I'm interested in Vue, Astro and anything related to front-end development.
